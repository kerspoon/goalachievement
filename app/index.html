<h2>Background</h2>

<p>
  <q>the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry</q> but why? And is there anything we can do about it?
</p>

<p>
  In work and in our home life so many of our plans never succeed. Many are doomed to failure before we start, but is this just how humans are or is it changeable? On the one side you have self-help workshops that often over-promise but are small on results; on the other you have scientific research which is difficult to distil down to a clear set of practical ideas. Researchers have been looking into what works for decades but, sadly, a lot of the work has not reached the general public.
</p>

<p>
  The good news is that there are some clear answers; in many areas the research has shown what works and what doesn't. With well researched, clearly presented ideas we can teach people how to make their goals much more likely to be achieved.
