      <h2>Background</h2>

      <p>
        “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry” but why? And is there anything we can do about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In work and in our home life so many of our plans never succeed. Many are doomed to failure before we start, but is this just how humans are or is it changeable? On the one side you have self-help workshops that often over-promise but are small on results; on the other you have scientific research which is difficult to distil down to a clear set of practical ideas. Researchers have been looking into what work for decades but, sadly, a lot of the work has not reached the general public.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is that we have some clear answers; in many areas we know what works and what doesn't. With well researched, clearly presented ideas we can teach people how to make their goals much more likely to be achieved.

      <h2 id="about">My History</h2>

      <p>
        Through my career I have taken on a number of roles. In all of these I take a pragmatic, researched-based approach to finding out what has been working best in the scientific literature and then applying that to my own tasks. This has led me from starting off a degree in Psychology and Communication Engineering, through a number of publications on artificial intelligence, and ending up with a Ph.D. in Quantifying Risks in Renewable Power Generation. Aside from that I have copy edited course texts for Power System Economics and I have been a cameraman, helped teach media skills to various executives, been a lead computer programmer at a start-up and a scrum master (leadership/management of a software development team). More recently my focus has shifted towards teaching people about habit forming, rapid skill acquisition, and goal achievement.

      <h2>The Workshops</h2>

      <p>
        The best way to teach these skills is in groups of 5-30 people where each concept (taken from academic research) is presented then applied to the needs of the group giving them a clear way to carry out the techniques and ideas. This is followed by a couple of rounds of practice and feedback to ensure everyone has a clear understanding and the ability to carry out the tasks.
      </p>

      <p>
        One technique that is a good starting point is called MCII - mental contrasting and implementation intentions. These are basically a series of questions you ask yourself when you have a task to carry out which greatly increase the likelihood of it actually being done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Depending on your specific needs there is a number of different techniques that can be taught. Ideally the workshops for each of these would be spaced out monthly to give everyone time to try out the techniques fully.
