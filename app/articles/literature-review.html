title: How to do a quick literature review
---

<p>
  Here is my method for a quick (one-three day) literature review on a specific topic. It assumes you already know the area but are looking for the cutting edge. If you are not at that stage yet then I would start by looking for (in vague order of simplicity):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Wikipedia articles,</li>
  <li>a Recent section(s) of a field-specific encyclopedia. For example &quot;The Routledge Encyclopedia of X&quot;. &quot;Compendium of X&quot;. &quot;The Cambridge Companion to X&quot;, &quot;Oxford Handbook of X&quot;.</li>
  <li>Read or skim-read an entry-level university textbook on the subject. Search the leading universities reading lists for recommendations.</li>
  <li>Find scholarly review (or &#39;survey&#39;) articles on the chosen topic from the past five years (the more recent, the better).</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Once you have a good overview and understand of the general topic you can being to answer specific questions.
</p>

<p>
  To start gather a set of search terms trying to keep them as specific as possible. Based on a variety of searches download about 30 papers from and google scholar based upon titles and names. Read the abstract of each just to see if it is relevant, discard those that are not.
</p>

<p>
  From here I read the title and abstract again to make sure I understand their basic premise. Next I read the references, I&#39;m looking for names, institutions and specific entries that come up a lot or seem very pertinent. I keep a log of any common ones I find. I&#39;m also looking for the terminology used in the titles in the references, again logging the best key phrases (I&#39;ll come back to this).
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this is to understand where this work fits relative to its peers and to find even better papers.
</p>

<p>
  The notes file will contain:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>key terms (e.g. the literature uses &quot;affective neuroscience&quot; instead of &quot;science of emotion&quot;)</li>
  <li>key researchers (e.g. J.Slootweg)</li>
  <li>key institutes (e.g. The University of Bath)</li>
  <li>key papers (e.g. IEEE-RTS-96)</li>
  <li>quotes (to provide as references): (e.g. &quot;priming will change peoples perception of value [Slootweg 2002]&quot;)</li>
  <li>questions/unverified findings/my thoughts and opinions (e.g. &quot;maybe wind speed is correlated with height above see level, I think it is&quot;)</li>
  <li>After this I should get a good feeling of where the work is situated with regards to its peers, hopefully I will already know of some of the work it has referenced and hence know where they are starting from. There are some things that stand out as a red flag, like not including Kundur&#39;s Key text for one area of my work or not having many references, or them all being old, or them all being from the same institute/country.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Next is the diagrams and conclusion. I&#39;m looking to see what was measured and what they found. I will have spent less than 5 mins reading each paper up to this point, it really is a brief look for specific things. I&#39;m not trying to understand everything just want to know if it is a good and relevant paper.
</p>

<p>
  Now I should know if it is well researched (from the references) and if I actually care about it (from the diagrams and conclusion). I will probably discard all but 5 at this point. I then print out the 5 papers and set them aside to read them later (start to finish in great detail actually making notes).
</p>

<p>
  After this I go back and make a new list of search terms based upon the key phrases. I will specifically be looking out for the names and institutes that came up in my first set of searches but obviously I don&#39;t only go for them. Then it&#39;s the same process. I do this until I&#39;ve got maybe 20 papers that are worth me understanding.
</p>

<p>
  If I find one particular person that comes up all the time I will search specifically for them and go to their university webpage to see what they are doing. I have three people who I kept a file on, I have read everything one guy had written.
</p>

<p>
  So the order is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Abstract</li>
  <li>References</li>
  <li>Diagrams and conclusion (but mainly diagrams)</li>
  <li>Everything (finally highlighting and taking notes)</li>
  <li>Everything once again (to make my final set of notes)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  And I don&#39;t make notes on the actual papers (other than the key players and terms etc.) until the last two steps. The steps are separate too, i.e. I read all the abstracts then all the references for every paper etc.
</p>

<p>
  As for what I make notes on, I keep a notebook of useful phrases to be used as my references later on. So, if someone has found that &quot;priming will change peoples perception of value&quot; I will keep that so that I can access it easily.
</p>

<p>
  I used jabref to keep track of the papers I had read and made my own summary on the papers I have printed out just so that I could remind myself quickly. After each literature review I would make a final set of notes on what I had learned, feelings and opinions, ideas for my own research, key findings, unexpected things, things to research more.
</p>

<p>
  There are a few review articles where everything could be highlighted, be happy.
</p>

<p>
  As a little aside I find it useful to write the year and how useful the paper is in big writing at the top and I only really highlight the best parts of that paper. Highlighting is to make stuff stand out.
</p>

<p>
  Summary: Make a first pass very quickly and work out the key people, places and phrases/words. Then use that list to find even better paper to read and only bother reading those in detail.
