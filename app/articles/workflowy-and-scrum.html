<h2>Knowing what's important is important</h2>

<p>
  A great way to get inspiration and new ideas by looking at how other have solved the same thing. About 6 months ago I took a course on being a <a href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum">Scrum Master</a>. This is "iterative and incremental agile software development framework for managing product development" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)), basically a way to a way to ensure you are getting the best value out of a team of software developers. The key element I wanted to try was having a "product backlog" - this is basically a list of everything your product owner wants to be developed sorted by how important it is.
</p>

<p>
  Here is why I did. First signup to workflowy (affiliate link here: XXX), next add an item called goals (or backlog if you want to stick with scrum terminology), then add everything that you think you want to get done. Every goal from "email a friend", to "travel the world". I use this as a dumping ground for new ideas. When you have a list of all the things that are important to you, start sorting them, put the things that are most important to you at the top.
</p>

<p>
  Every day I empty my emails, my facebook inbox, my text messages, and copy stuff across from my notepad. Adding them all to my goals section (or dealing with them straight away if I can do it quickly). Next I look at the most important couple of goals and write down a really small step that can get me started. It might simply be writing down what info I need to gather before I can fill out a tax return.
</p>

<p>
  The advantages:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Whenever I have a spare 15 mins in my day (e.g waiting for a friend to get ready before we go out) I have a clearly defined, easy task that is very important to me.
  </li>
  <li>
    When I have a longer period to work on my goals I have a easy method of starting - the simple task. Often starting is the hardest part, when that is done the rest is easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    It makes it a lot easier to compare how important different goals are if they are explicitly written out. They do change priority quite often but having it written out really helps. (e.g. the goal "socialise more" might be top one week and right down the bottom the next depending on how I feel at any time)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  I did find that looking through such a long list every day become a little overwhelming so I have recently been playing with having a new list called my "weekly horizon" it is a much shorter list containing only the things I want to focus on this week. It seems to be be helping.
</p>

<p>
  A few months after I has started this approach I found that one of the big names in Scrum has posted an article about someone else doing a similar thing to me, http://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/the-agile-household-how-scrum-made-us-a-better-family
