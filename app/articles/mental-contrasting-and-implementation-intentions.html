title: MCII - mental contrasting and implementation intentions
---


<p>These are some great techniques for taking an aim and making a much more achievable objective out of it. It will also help you drop goals that you realize are not worth the effort. Here we will talk about two such techniques:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mental Contrasting (ask yourself: where do I want to be, what's stopping me being there)</li>
  <li>Implementation Intentions AKA Triggers (whenever situation X arises I will do Y)</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="mental-contrasting">Mental Contrasting</h2>

<q>"Imagine the attainment of the desired future and reflect on the present reality that stands in the way of obtaining it."</q>

<p>You want to consider alternating points of view of the goal. You want to be overly pessimistic about how hard it will be (i.e. think it will be difficult) but optimistic about your chance of success. The idea is to get to a point where you think:</p>

<p>"This will be hard to achieve but I know, with a lot of self control and effort I can do it, and it really will be worth it."</p>

<p>The way to do this is to alternate between thinking of reasons why the task will be difficult (or why you could fail) then think of why it is important to you to achieve.</p>
<p>When you are thinking of the difficulties imagine yourself in a realistic situation where you are likely to give up. Think up a bad day where you are hungry, annoyed, lonely, and/or tired (H.A.L.T). After you have put yourself in that mindset imagine what would tip you over the edge into failing your goal in some way. By picturing you mental state it will help you have a more realistic view of you chances for success.</p>
<p>Then imagine that you have already achieved the goal. Think of the reasons why it helped you or made your life better. You can also imagine what it would be like to not achieve the goal. Really think if this would make any difference or not. This will help you work out how important the goal is to you. It is important to be brutally honest.</p>
<p>Repeat this cycle two or three times and you should have a good idea if you are likely to put in the effort when it counts, and if that effort is worth it. You should need very long to do this, just make sure you do each part in turn (think first of the difficulties, then the reasons).</p>
<p>You might realise that when the chips are down and you are hungry, angry, lonely, tired or just having a bad day you are likely to give up. If this is the case (remember to be a bit pessimistic about this) then don’t bother working on the goal. You have already decided that it is not worth the effort. If you think you cannot succeed when you are planning you will have no hope when some unexpected challenge pops up.</p>
<p>It is also worth quickly thinking through an “if-then” reaction for your sticking points that you have identified. For example, if you are trying to run every day but you know some days you feel tired and find it difficult to start. In that case you could set the response to be "If I ever feel too tired to start running then I will put my running shoes on and leave the house whether I actually run or not." The problem is likely to be self-control depletion not exhaustion, by getting to the point of actually running you have lowered the mental effort of starting.</p>
<p>In other words repeatedly as yourself "why do it" and "what's stopping me". Here are some ways to phrase those questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Why am I doing this?</li>
  <li>What is the most likely thing to cause me to fail? Imagine you are: Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired (H.A.L.T) then imagine having to do the task; would you still do it?</li>
  <li>How would my life be different a week after completing the goal compared to if I hadn't done it?</li>
  <li>Imagine the scenario where you fail the task, why was that?</li>
  <li>How would your life be different a year after the task?</li>
  <li>Think of another reason why you might have failed.</li>
  <li>Am I excited to get started?</li>
  <li>Do I think I will succeed?</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="if-then-triggers-implementation-intentions-">If-Then Triggers (Implementation Intentions)</h2>

<p>"Whenever situation x arises, I will initiate the goal-directed response y!"</p>
<p>The trigger should be vivid and concrete. e.g not "when I finish washing up" but "when I put the last item into the drying rack". It's good to use the end of one thing that happens regularly as the trigger for a goal. The task should just specify the first thing you need to do and it should require no decisions at all. e.g. not "stretch for 10 mins" but "set stopwatch for 10 mins and swing left leg". Once you have started you can work out the rest of what to do.</p>
<p>The key to this method of goal setting is to set up simple triggers and a mechanical starting point. A trigger is something to tell you when to start working on your goal, a mechanical task is one that can be done with no thinking, or at least without conscious thought. By thinking of your goal in terms of triggers and starting points you can form a habit much quicker. For example if you goal is to become more flexible you should convert this into one with trigger and a mechanical starting point.</p>
<p>The trigger should specify exactly where and when you start, a good example would be "straight after brushing your teeth every weekday morning" (this is only a good example if you already have the habit of brushing your teeth every morning), a bad example would be "at 8:15am", what happens if you wake up a bit late and are brushing your teeth at that time. A further problem with purely time based triggers is that you wont be able to tell it is exactly 8:15 unless you set an alarm and in a lot of cases it is not practical to have many alarms going off through the day.</p>
<p>A mechanical starting point is something that gets you started without having to think. Setting your alarm for 10mins and swinging your leg back and forward would be a good starting point for the goal of become more flexible. If your goal was to write a book a good starting point would be to get out your notebook and read through the last bit of what you wrote last time. A bad starting point would be to continue writing where you left off last time, that requires conscious thought.</p>
<p>Some goals do not have a time based trigger at all, for example "not snacking" applies all the time. You still want to form a habit that your subconscious can follow without having to deplete your self control. In that cause I would suggest framing the goal in terms of "if ... then ..." e.g. <strong>if</strong> I feel the urge to snack <strong>then</strong> I will eat a few nuts and seeds and drink a glass of water. For goals like this you can also factor in the brain taking the easiest option, if you make it a real effort to get to the snacks you will be less likely to do so.</p>
