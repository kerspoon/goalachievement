title: How to do a Yearly Review
---

<p>
  For the last few years I have written a review of what my year has been like and areas I want to work on in the coming year. I've found it really useful and wanted to share it with you. You can download the <a href="/assets/YearlyReview.docx">yearly review template</a> if you want to try it out yourself.
</p>

<p>
  The purpose of this is to generate rough areas to work on. It is not to come up with actionable goals - doing this process is not going make your goals more likely to be achieved. I hope that it will give you goals that are more aligned to what you actually want to get better at.
</p>



<h2>Steps</h2>

<p>
  This last one took me about 4 hours. It's split into 3 sections:
</p>

<ul>
 
  <li>
    <strong>Review the past year (1h)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>First, I look through my last 12 monthly reviews and make notes (especially on things that changed my happiness or motivation)</li>
      <li>Next, I comment on how I did with each of the goals I set myself last year (especially what went well, what I want to keep doing, and why certain things didn’t pan out).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Review myself (1.5h)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>First, I make a list of people - the ones who inspire me (even if I haven’t met them), or people that I love being around. </li>
      <li>Next, I work out how I spend my time (what do I do on a normal day/week, a fantastic day/week, activities I have done, project, hobbies)</li>
      <li>Then, I write a list of the top 10 to 20 things I love doing. Sorted by how much I love it.</li>
      <li>I do a similar thing for projects and hobbies sorted by how important they are to me.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    <strong>Make some goals (1.5h)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>I start by writing down anything that I might want as a goal for the year. I end up getting rid of most of them. (I have a log of potential habits and goals which I use along with the notes I have just made the the first two sections)</li>
      <li>Next, I try to think of 2 or 3 goals for each of the categories below (I could also come up with 2 or 3 for each project/hobby)</li>
      <li>Then I prioritise. Ending up with about 6 top, 6 middle, and 6 lower priority areas for the year.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>





<h2>Categories</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Intellectual (books, subjects)</li>
  <li>Health (diet, exercise, sleep)</li>
  <li>Emotions (feel more/less of, more control)</li>
  <li>Career (is the career path you are on leading you to a place you want to be)</li>
  <li>Financial (are you happy with how much you spend, save, earn)</li>
  <li>Social (people to spend more/less time around, what kind of people do you want to meet)</li>
  <li>Fun (what do you want to do)</li>
  <li>Personal (what character traits do you want to change)</li>
  <li>Philanthropic (how do you want to help others, or help the world)</li>
  <li>Relationship</li>
  <li>Motivation</li>
  <li>Habits</li>
  <li>Experiments</li>
</ul>




<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>
  To make sure I actually work on these areas I do a similar review every month and every week. In the monthly one, I pick 2 or 3 of my yearly goals to work on. In the weekly one, I turn the monthly goals into tasks (e.g. send an email), or habits/routines of the format “if/when ____ happens then I will ____”. 
</p>




<h2>What I Found This Year</h2>

<p>
  Here are some useful things I found in my last yearly review:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>My biggest factors for motivation/efficiency are: not being ill or tired, having a clear idea of exactly what I need to work on, and scheduling an entire evening to work on my to do list or projects.</li>
  <li>In my mood/emotions: I love 1-on-1 intellectual/deep conversations, and having a clear inbox and todo list.</li>
  <li>In the last 5 months I set myself 162 tasks or habits. I completed or did well on 123 of them. Hence on average I complete 73% of the tasks I set myself. More importantly I know why I did/didn’t do them and can work to make this figure higher.</li>
</ul>
