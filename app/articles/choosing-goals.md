title: A quick guide to choosing goals
---

Every year I take some time to come up with areas of focus for the year ahead. These are not as specific as my weekly goals in that I cannot directly carry them out (e.g. "improve my rock climbing" is an area of focus whereas "go rock climbing on Tuesday and Thursday" is much more actionable). This sets the tone for my year, often my priorities will change but I still find value in knowing my long term plan. For me this process takes about 4 hours.

## 1. Make notes on how the last year has been

I start by reading through my notes on the goals I have set each month for the last year, along with looking through my calendar to help remind me of what it was I actually did. I'll also read through my last yearly review and think about the areas I have made progress. After this is done I should have a good base to start thinking about what I want out of the next year. I'll have normally written down about 10-20 key bullet points but the main takeaway is priming myself with all of last years plans.

Next comes thinking up potential goals for each of the following categories. They don't have to be good ones, the list will be cut down later to just the things I really care about. The idea behind this is that focusing on specific areas for short periods of time produces better ideas than freely thinking about it for a long period.

## 2. Roles, Legacy and Knowledge

This section is mostly taken from "what color is your parachute".

+ What roles do you play for other people, are you a teacher, a brother,
+ What do you want to leave behind when you are gone, how do you want the world to change.
+ What things do you know how to do and what skills do you have.
+ How do you spend your time? write a few notes on what you do in a typical week, a typical weekend.

## 3. List your favorites

Mostly taken from the 80/20 principle

+ People: who do you love to spend time with (especially if you don't currently spend time with them very often)
+ Activities: both specific activities (football) and general topics (new foods)
+ Flow: what makes you lose all sense of time and get lost in a world of focus
+ Places: at places or types of places make you happy just for being there.

## 2. Think of 2 goals for each category

+ Intellectual (books, subjects)
+ Health (diet, exercise, sleep)
+ Emotions (feel more/less of, more control)
+ Career (is the career path you are on leading you to a place you want to be)
+ Financial (are you happy with how much you spend, save, earn)
+ Social (people to spend more/less time around, what kind of people do you want to meet)
+ Fun (what do you want to do)
+ Personal (what character traits do you want to change)
+ Philanthropic (how do you want to help others, or help the world)

When you have come up with the goals **rank them by importance**: I use low, medium, and high.

## Review your review

Finally write a couple of sentences on how that process went and how you think you could do it better next time.
