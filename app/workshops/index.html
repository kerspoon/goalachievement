<h2>Bespoke Training</h2>

<p>
  You want to get the best out of your employees. To make sure they are both happy, and productive. We can provide tailored training for you and your team on just how to do that. The format is fairly flexible ranging from a free 1-hour introduction, to a multiple day course delving deep into how to be productive.
</p>

<h2>Teaching Format</h2>

<p>
  The best way to teach these skills is in groups of 5-30 people where each concept (taken from academic research) is presented then applied to the needs of the group giving them a clear way to carry out the techniques and ideas. This is followed by a couple of rounds of practice and feedback to ensure everyone has a clear understanding and the ability to carry out the tasks. The more time there is available the deeper we can explore how to actually apply these ideas.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Framework</strong> - what is is we generally want to do here.</li>
  <li><strong>Research Technique</strong> - what ideas can we get from research.</li>
  <li><strong>Application</strong> - how should we apply this to ourselves.</li>
  <li><strong>Check</strong> - how can we make it likely that we will do the application.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Example Topics</h2>

<p>
  Depending on your specific needs there are a number of different techniques that can be taught. Ideally the workshops for each of these would be spaced out monthly to give everyone time to try out the techniques fully.
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Vision-Mission-Goals</strong>: working out what your goals should be</li>
  <li><strong>Habits</strong>: both acquiring useful habits and getting rid of bad ones</li>
  <li><strong>Rapidly Acquiring New Skills</strong>: Deliberate practice and Feedback</li>
  <li><strong>Mindset</strong>: noticing and reducing the unnecessary limitations we set ourselves</li>

  <li><strong>Flow</strong>: getting into the zone</li>
  <li><strong>Situational Changes</strong>: changing the environment we spend time in radically changes our actions</li>
  <li><strong>Achievable Goals</strong>: taking a vague aim and turning it into something concrete and achievable.</li>
</ul>
